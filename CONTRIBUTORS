# This is the official list of people who can contribute
# (and typically have contributed) code to the Tanmatsu repository.
# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file
# lists people.  For example, Kusubooru employees are listed here
# but not in AUTHORS, because Kusubooru holds the copyright.
#

# Names should be added to this file like so:
#     Individual's name <submission email address>

# Please keep the list sorted.
